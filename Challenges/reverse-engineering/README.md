# Reverse Engineering

Reverse Engineering is the process of analyzing a system, device, or software to understand how it works and uncover its internal structure and components. This process is often used to gain insight into the workings of a system, to discover vulnerabilities that can be exploited, or to create an interoperable system. Reverse engineering is a complex process that requires knowledge of hardware, software, and programming.
